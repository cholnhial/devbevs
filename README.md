# DEVBEVS
Gotta! keep them developers hydrated. This is a practice application mainly to practice Spring Security and NGRX.
It uses Spring Boot for the backend and Angular for the frontend. This application will also get me to develop custom CSS and grid system for the frontend.

This application allows devs (the main users) to choose drinks for each day and at what time. There are scheduled drink runs at specified times by the company. 
Users can change choices until 1hr before the scheduled run.
